# 8bit cpu for bitvm
Write bitvm programs without learning circuit diagrams

# What is this?
This project contains a boolean logic circuit that emulates a turing complete 8 bit cpu that can run in bitvm. It also contains a debugger and state machine visualizer I wrote in bash, and an Assembly compiler someone else wrote in python, and which I modified. Coders can now program bitvm in an Assembly language rather than having to manually craft ever more complex boolean logic circuits.

# What is the status?
Every component of the cpu has been successfully tested. The last thing I successfully tested was a conditional jump instruction I wrote for its Assembly decoder, which makes the cpu turing complete. It currently supports 12 Assembly instructions documented below. So the status is: you can write programs in Assembly (using only the commands it currently supports), convert them to binary using the compiler.py file included in this repository, store the programs in RAM, run the computer, read the results it produces, and (I haven't tested this part yet) even lock up some bitcoins so that they can only be unlocked by your counterparty if he or she runs your program with inputs that produce some results you want.

One thing I still need to do is write some javascript to decode bytes of RAM from 1s and 0s into something a human can understand -- like sprites on a screen, or text on a command prompt. Also, there is currently no way to actually run these programs on bitcoin, the simulator only runs in the browser and offline -- but the programs truly are compatible with bitvm, they really are! I hope to add a button soon that lets you export your program in a bitcoin address so you can use it the way bitvm is intended.

# Supported commands
```
0. NOP -- do nothing
1. LDA -- load a value from ram into register A
2. ADD -- add the number in whatever byte you specify to the number currently in register A
3. SUB -- subtract the number in whatever byte you specify from the number currently in register A
4. STA -- store register A in ram
5. LDI -- load a value directly into register A (not from ram)
6. JMP -- jump to another instruction
7. JIC -- jump to another instruction if the carry bit is set, that is, if register A overflowed while computing a previous instruction (this allows for "bounded loops" so that the cpu can run a loop for X number of times and then break out of it)
8. HLT -- stop the computer (actually stops the microinstruction counter from incrementing so that the computer stops changing its state til it runs out of cycles)
9. .org -- initialize a byte of ram to a certain value (used in combination with .word)
10. .word -- the value to initialize a byte of ram to (used in combination with .org)
11. labels -- Assembly lets you name your functions using labels. An example is given in test_program.asm. Named functions can be written once and then called one or more times throughout your program without having to write out the code multiple times.
```

Commands 1-10 (but not 8) take parameters. After specifying the command, give a number 0-15. Commands 1, 2, 3, and 4 use this number to set the ram to that byte, which it then loads into A (LDA), adds to A (ADD), subtracts from A (SUB), or overwrites with the contents of A (STA). Command 5 puts the number you specify directly into register A (usually it's a 1 or a 0 but it can be anything from 0 to 15). Commands 6 and 7 use the number you specify to determine which Assembly instruction in your program you want to jump to. Command 9 uses the number you specify to select a byte of ram so that, with the next command (.word), you can initialize it to a certain value. The .word command uses the number you specifiy to initialize the previously-selected byte of ram to the value of the number you picked.

# How to use the installable compiler

Create a .asm file with your program in it. See the example .asm programs included in this repository for help with getting the syntax right. Some of the programs are also explained below, under Sample Programs, in case you have trouble understanding how Assembly works. Also feel free to jump in [our telegram chat](https://t.me/bitvm_chat) and ask for help. To test a program, first run the compiler like this:

```
python3 compiler.py my_program.asm -o my_program.bin
```

I eventually plan to let you upload the .bin file the compiler generates, but for right now I made the compiler also spit out a copy/pastable version of the binary. Enter that into the online demo page [here](https://supertestnet.github.io/8bit-cpu-for-bitvm/) -- just click "Use your own," then begin incrementing the clock, and watch as your program runs in the computer.

# Compiler caveats

The compiler is slightly modified from this project: https://github.com/tayler6000/BenEater8BitAssembler It was originally written for a different computer so I had to modify it to get it to work with this one. Due to my modifications, there may be compatibility issues between the compiler and this computer. More testing is needed to determine if it works properly. If you find any bugs, please create an issue on this repository.

Also note that Assembly expects a certain syntax. Almost all lines of your code should be indented with exactly 2 spaces. The only exception is for labels. Labels are not supposed to be indented, they must be only 1 word (but you can use underscores), and they need a colon after them. You can learn more by watching youtube videos about how Assembly works, but remember that Assembly has a lot of instructions in it and this computer only supports the ones documented above, so don't go hog wild with all the crazy stuff Assembly can do on other computers -- just stick to the things it can do on *this* computer or the compiler will get mad and throw an error.

# Sample programs

## Count forever
The following program initializes the A register to 0 and then begins an incrementation loop, incrementing that register by 3 repeatedly. It gets stuck in this loop until the cpu stops cycling. In an ideal world, it would never stop cycling, but on bitcoin, it must stop before 2^128 cycles go by because bitcoin addresses don't have enough tapleaves to make more cycles than that.

Here it is in Assembly:

```
  LDI 0
  ADD 15
  STA 14
  JMP 1

  .org 15
  .word 3
```

**Explanation of the above program**

0. `LDI 0` - initialize A to 0
1. `ADD 15` - then add whatever is in byte 15 of ram to A
2. `STA 14` - then store whatever is in A in byte 14 of ram
3. `JMP 1` - go back to ADD 15 and loop
4. `.org 15` - this tells the compiler to initialize byte 15 to a certain value
5. `.word 3` - this tells the compiler what value to initialize the previously-referenced byte to

Here is the binary:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
```

## Bounded loop test
The following program initializes the A register to a high value (252) and then enters an incrementation loop, incrementing that register by 1 repeatedly. It would get stuck in that loop forever, except that the JIC instruction causes it to depart the loop when Register A overflows due to being too small to hold the number 256. The JIC flag thus breaks it out of the loop, skipping to an instruction that stores the contents of the A register (which are now 0 due to the overflow) and halts the cpu.

Here it is in Assembly:

```
  LDI 1
  STA 14
  LDA 15
  ADD 14
  JIC 6
  JMP 3
  STA 15
  HLT

  .org 15
  .word 252
```

**Explanation of the above program**

0. `LDI 1` - initialize register A with the value 1
1. `STA 14` - then store that in byte 14 of ram
2. `LDA 15` - then put whatever is in byte 15 of ram in A (this makes it 252 because I booted the cpu with byte 15 already set to 252)
3. `ADD 14` - then add whatever is in byte 14 of ram to A (so add 1+252)
4. `JIC 6` - if the carry bit is set (i.e. if A overflowed) jump to the 7th instruction (which, counting from 0, is instruction 6)
5. `JMP 3` - go back to ADD 14 and loop (this instruction gets skipped once the A register overflows, thus letting us break out of the loop)
6. `STA 15` - then store whatever is in A in byte 15 of ram
7. `HLT` - this stops the computer
8. `.org 15` - this tells the compiler to initialize byte 15 to a certain value
9. `.word 252` - this tells the compiler what value to initialize the previously-referenced byte to

Here it is in binary (with the 15th byte of RAM initialized to 252, not documented in the Assembly code)

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

# Big caveat
This cpu only has 16 bytes of ram. Don't expect to validate bitcoin signatures or sync a light client in it, 16 bytes of ram isn't enough for anything but proofs-of-concept. You can demonstrate that bitvm is turing complete (and therefore so is bitcoin, since bitvm is a layer of bitcoin) but you probably can't do anything useful til someone makes a better cpu for bitvm with more ram. Consider that a challenge -- both the "make a better one" part and the "you can't do anything useful with this" part. I'd love to be proven wrong about that last one!

# What was your inspiration?
I had several inspirations. One of them came from making fun of ethereum's virtual machine one day. I joked that it isn't powerful enough to be a "world computer" (as some of the early hype claimed it was) because it only has about as much processing power as a gameboy. And then I realized that's not something to scoff at, that's super cool. And how cool would it be if *I* can emulate the original gameboy's cpu in bitvm and give people a way to validate whether someone successfully ran a gameboy ROM on bitcoin. If that's possible, you could lock up some bitcoins for someone that they can only take if they prove they beat you in [Doom](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IXA1crHYPJE). How awesome would that be! So I started learning about the gameboy's cpu to see if it is feasible to emulate it in bitvm.

While researching the gameboy I realized that I know next to nothing about programming at that low level -- i.e. I don't know how to design a boolean logic circuit capable of running programs written in a programming language like Assembly. So I started learning about 8bit computer design (the gameboy uses an 8bit cpu) from [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) by Ben Eater, and, since -- for every part of the design process -- he gives you direct instructions with helpful visuals and hands-on examples, I found I could follow his instructions in a circuit board simulator called [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

I also started making Ben's examples my own by tweaking them for use in bitvm. For example, I took one of the early circuits I produced (an 8 bit "alu" or arithmetic and logic unit) and made a [github project](https://github.com/supertestnet/8bit-alu-for-bitvm) for it where I included not only my logisim file but a logically-equivalent circuit that I wrote using python's circuit library, which I then exported into bristol fashion using python's Bristol Fashion Circuit Library. I also successfully ran a closely related 8bit adder in bitvm that I also produced while following Ben Eater's instructions.

# What's next?
Now that the cpu works and is documented, I hope to write creative programs for it and help inspire others to do likewise. Hopefully that will attract the attention of some smarter developers who can design *better* cpus for bitvm -- I dream of a 16 bit cpu and then a 32 bit cpu capable of running the linux operating system and any linux program. Imagine writing smart contracts for bitcoin in popular, modern languages like javascript or python. I don't think we're anywhere near there yet but we're probably closer than we've ever been, and I can't wait to see what's next.
